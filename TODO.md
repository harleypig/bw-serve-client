  - Ensure compatibility across supported Python versions
  - Add version-specific test configurations if needed

- [ ] **Regular mypy/pydantic auditing**
  - Set up automated mypy checking in CI/CD pipeline
  - Create process for regular type safety audits
  - Review and update pydantic models as API evolves
  - Ensure mypy and pydantic integration remains optimal
  - Add type checking to pre-commit hooks

- [ ] **Add pylint for comprehensive code analysis**
  - Integrate pylint into CI/CD pipeline for thorough code review
  - Configure pylint rules to complement flake8 and yapf

  - Show error handling patterns
  - Demonstrate authentication setup

## Code Quality and Standards
- [ ] **Implement pre-commit hooks**
  - Set up `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for checks only
  - Set up `.pre-commit-config-fix.yaml` for auto-fixes
  - Include flake8, mypy, yapf, and other quality tools
  - Ensure all hooks are platform-portable

- [ ] **Code formatting and linting**
  - Run yapf for consistent code formatting
  - Fix all flake8 violations
  - Resolve mypy type checking issues
  - Follow PEP 8 and project naming conventions

## Package Configuration
- [ ] **Update pyproject.toml**
  - Ensure all dependencies are properly specified
  - Add proper package metadata
  - Configure build system correctly
  - Add proper license information

- [ ] **Package structure**
  - Organize code into logical modules

  - Add type hints throughout codebase
  - Implement proper package exports

## CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] **Set up GitHub Actions**
  - Create workflow for testing on multiple Python versions
  - Add code quality checks
  - Implement automated testing
  - Add coverage reporting

- [ ] **Release automation**
