# Bitwarden CLI Vault Management API

This module supports the [Bitwarden CLI Vault Management
API](https://bitwarden.com/help/vault-management-api/), available via
Bitwarden CLI's `bw serve` command.

If you're looking for Bitwarden's public api (for organizational tools and
stuff) that API is [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/api/)

Please note that this module won't be supporting email and master password
login to start with. It's not the most secure method, but pull requests are
welcome. Also, SSO support is low on the todo list, as the author doesn't use
it.
